# Problem Tracker

This app is very useful if you solve DSA or do competitive programming on a regular basis on different platforms.

As it helps you track your problems and gives you a visual representation of how many problems you have solved in the past, you can also search to see if you have previously solved a particular problem or not. Additionally, you can check on which day you solved a specific number of problems.
